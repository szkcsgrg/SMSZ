## Description

This project started in the middle of 2019 after I first met with HTML and CSS. After
learning the basics I had the opportunity to create a website for them.
For a company, a stunning website is needed. In 2022 we talked about a new design
concept. A few months later I finished this simple one-page site.
In the latest version of the page, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, **SASS**, **Bootstrap**, **JavaScript**, and
**jQuery**.
